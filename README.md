This repository includes some of the Tech Academy projects I completed within the JavaScript course.

Some of the projects I completed are listed below:


Pizza Project: Within this project you can order a pizza and are provided the total price by selecting the size and various toppings.

TicTacToe: Play a fun game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer. Animations along with fun sounds are included in this project.

To Do App: Make a list of things you need to complete, items you need to shop for, or anything you need to remember to do. 

Calculator: Yup! It's a calculator. Add, subtract, multiply and divide! Believe it or not, you'll actually get the correct answers!


You will also find a variety of challenges and assignments created to learn and practice various types of coding such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even a bit of jQuery!

Enjoy!
